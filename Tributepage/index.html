            <p>Albert Einstein was born at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany, on March 14, 1879. Six weeks later the family moved to Munich, where he later on began his schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium. Later, they moved to Italy and Albert continued his education at Aarau, Switzerland and in 1896 he entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich to be trained as a teacher in physics and mathematics. In 1901, the year he gained his diploma, he acquired Swiss citizenship and, as he was unable to find a teaching post, he accepted a position as technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office. In 1905 he obtained his doctor’s degree.

        <p>Albert Einstein was born to Hermann Einstein who was a salesman and engineer, and mother Pauline Einstein. During his childhood days his father once showed him a pocket compass. This made Einstein realized that having apparent empty space around still there must be something causing the needle to move. Since then Einstein showed a keen interest in mathematics and science.</p>

        <p>Albert Einstein acquired Swiss citizenship in February 1901, and later he obtained a job in Bern at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property, the patent office. He was an assistant examiner who was responsible for the evaluation of patent applications for electromagnetic devices. In 1903, Einstein's position at the Swiss Patent Office became permanent, where he fully mastered machine technology.
            During same time at Bern, Einstein along with his few known friends founded “The Olympia Academy". This academy was a place for carrying discussions on science and philosophy inviting the subject enthusiasts.
